The jupyter notebook: []() in this folder provide example scripts to analyze raw z-stack images into spatial coordinates. 


Initialize Cell_List class

Segmentation for all field-of-views

Create cell objects

Crop sequential images for each cell

Pick chromosomes

Multi-fitting candidate spots for chromosomes

Pick spots to acquire region coordinates

Generate population median distance map / contact probability map

Save processed data into single file for further analysis
