# ChromatinImaging/Diffraction-limited Image Analysis

### This contains scripts for the difraction-limited image analysis of raw images. 
### The StandardAnalysis script was used for:
### IMR90 (chr21:18.6Mb-20.6Mb, chr21:28Mb-30Mb)
### A549 (chr21:28Mb-30Mb)
### HCT116 (chr21:28Mb-30Mb,chr21:34.6Mb-37.1Mb)

### Sample data is provided for a 6 cropped fields of view for the IMR90 (chr21:18.6Mb-20.6Mb).

### The output of this analysis is a list of coordinates for the centers of 30kb segments comprising the genomic region labelled.
