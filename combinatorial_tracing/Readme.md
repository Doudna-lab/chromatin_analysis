This folder contains the code for analyzing the DNA-MERFISH combinatorial chromatin tracing data.

It includes 3 folders:

"GenerateEncodingProbes" - used to generate the encoding probes to target DNA loci or intronic RNA foci.

"ImageAnalysis" - used to transform the raw image data into 3D positional data.

"PostAnalysis" - used for further statistical analysis of the 3D positions of the chromatin loci/ RNA foci after the image analysis above.
